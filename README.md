Essential Swift Demos
===========

Welcome to our demos repository for 
[Essential Swift iOS and OS X Programming Course](https://www.develop.com/training-course/essential-swift-ios-and-os-x-programming) 
from [DevelopMentor](https://develop.com). 

If you are in one of our courses *right now*, **start by selecting your course's branch** and then just click 'Download ZIP' or clone this repo to your system. On the other hand, if you took the course awhile ago and want access to the demos, your course has probably been **moved to another branch**. Use the branches dropdown to find it just contact us (requests@develop.com).

Course Outline
----------------------

**What you will learn in this course**

When Apple announced the Swift programming language to cheering crowds at WWDC 2014, we knew it would be important. Swift is destined to replace the aging Objective-C language which was introduced over 32 years ago. Swift is built upon three core principles: safe, modern, and powerful. It fulfills these principles by borrowing the best features from modern languages such as Python, C#, modern C++, and others. While Swift adopts modern high-level language features it also improves upon Objective-C’s native performance and is actually faster than its predecessor.

This course is a deep, practical, and hands-on exploration of the Swift language and surrounding ecosystem. You will learn why Swift was introduced. You will see how Swift is a safe, modern, and powerful language. You will learn how to build iOS (iPhone and iPad) applications as well as native OS X applications using Xcode. All of these lessons will be reinforced with hands-on exercises and many example applications built live during class.

There are cross-platform options for building iOS and OS X applications. However, if you are ready to go all in on the Apple ecosystem you need to learn Swift today. This comprehensive course is a great place to start.

**Course outline and topics**

**Day 1**

**Introduction to Swift for iOS and OS X**

This first module introduces developers to the Swift ecosystem. You will learn why Swift was created and understand how it fits into the Apple developer ecosystem. You will learn about the various tools and SDKs needed to start building applications.

**Language Basics**

Swift is a modern language which borrows many of the best features from successful, established languages of the day such as Python and C#. Swift values readability and productivity over terseness. In this lesson, you will get a quick introduction to the major language features. We will see how to define variables and understand Swift's variable scope. Next up is a variety of flow control constructs (if, while, etc.). We will pay special attention to loops in Swift, which has traditional for and while loops but also adds rich iteration and range based loop constructs. Finally we discuss how to import external libraries to extend our capabilities.

**Types and collections**

Swift has a rich type system. This lesson explores some of the fundamental types and tips for working with them (numbers, strings, dates, etc.). Next we move on to the collection classes (arrays and dictionaries). These types have very powerful features and only some of them are covered in this lesson (saving the best for deeper examination later). You will learn to splice (via subscript ranges), combine, and generally manipulate these collections here.

**Functions and closures**

Functions, along with classes, are key building blocks of any self-respecting language. Swift's support for functions is very sophisticated. We start by defining basic functions and discussing parameters, return values, and related concepts. Unlike many languages, you will see that Swift functions naturally support returning multiple return values and assigning them all in one step. You will see how to define functions with varying numbers of parameters, how to create named parameters, and work with default and optional parameters. Finally we look at some of the best features of functions enabling modern, concise programming techniques: closures, expressions, and lambdas in Swift.

**Day 2**

**Optionals, Optional Chaining, and Generics**

The Swift language adds two clean and powerful features to the developer's toolkit: optional chaining and generics. Unlike most languages, Swift types cannot be null / nil. Even though Swift has both value types and reference types, they must have a value. To specifically allow for missing values, Swift introduces optionals and optional chaining to work with these types. Using optional chaining you can entirely avoid those one-line if statements required to juggle null / nil optionals and reference types. We will also cover generics, a powerful feature to use strong-typed features in a general way.

**Classes and Structures**

Swift is a first class object-oriented language. You will see how to define your own classes and how to add methods and fields to them. We will cover how to hook into object lifetime and initialization. You will also see how to distinguish between classes and structures. Although defining structures is similar to classes, their runtime semantics are quite different and are appropriate in times when classes may not be.

**Protocols and Extensions**

Next up are two powerful features for extending, adapting, and reusing types. We will begin by learning about protocols. If you are coming from another language, you may know these as interfaces. Protocols allow your types (classes, structs, and enums) to guarantee they support a minimum level of functionality and allow for greater type reuse and polymorphism. Protocols work great when extending types you control. But Swift has another feature which allows you to add functionality and features to existing types even types imported from other libraries like the String class. These are extensions and they are a powerful feature not found in many other languages.

**Memory management**

In this module, you will learn the ins-and-outs of memory management in Swift. Swift has two broad categories of types (reference types and value types) and you will see they differ dramatically in how memory is managed for these types. You will learn when and how to use each of these and how to identify them. We will see, that for reference types, Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to track and manage your app’s memory usage. In most cases, this means that memory management 'just works' in Swift, and you do not need to think about memory management yourself. We will discuss various types of references and see how they affect memory management (strong, weak, and unowned references) references.

**Day 3**

**Day of iOS**

Now that you're proficient in the Swift language, it's time to look at some real-world applications on the iOS platform. We will spend this day exploring how to build iOS applications with Swift. Learning about storyboards, UIViewControllers, and the various UI widgets in UIKit.

**Day 4**

**Day of OS X**

While iOS is a popular platform, Swift is also a first class environment for building OS X applications. You will learn about building OS X using Xcode and Swift and see several real-world examples throughout the lessons.
